# JConnect

JConnect is a Java-based chat application utilizing socket programming, multi-threading, and Java Swing for its graphical user interface. Designed to support real-time messaging across multiple clients, this project showcases core concepts of client-server architecture and concurrent programming, providing a user-friendly chat interface.

## Features
- **Multiple Client Support**: Allows multiple clients to connect and chat in real-time.
- **Multiple Server Capability**: Any user can host a chat group on their own PC.
- **Point to point chat**: Point to point chat also allowed
- **Chat History**: Messages are stored so that late joiners can access past conversations.
- **Swing UI**: Includes a graphical interface built with Java Swing (interface design is functional but may be improved).

## Technologies Used
- **Java Socket Programming**: For managing server-client connections and real-time communication.
- **Multi-threading**: Supports concurrent connections using individual threads per client.
- **Java Swing**: Provides a basic, functional graphical user interface for both server and client.
